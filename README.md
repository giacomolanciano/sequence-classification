# Sequence Classification
Final project for Neural Networks course at Universit√† degli Studi di Roma "La Sapienza" A.Y. 2016/2017, developed in collaboration 
with Luca Marchetti and Leonardo Martini. It consists in the implementation and performance analysis of two different approaches 
for proteins sequences classification:
- SVM equipped with an ad-hoc implementation of **Spectrum Kernel**
- **Recurrent Neural Network** (developed with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) framework)

See our [report](https://github.com/giacomolanciano/sequence-classification/blob/master/sequence_classification.pdf) for further
details and instructions on how to run the code.
